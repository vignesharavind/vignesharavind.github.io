“The unscientific procedure employed during assembly of femoral head over the stem”.  This results in application of less or more force than 4.5 ± 0.5 KN. It leads to loosening of femoral head or head/stem interface damage.

### Proposed solution & Design Objective / Criteria

We propose an Automatic-Hammer to ensure application of 4.5 ± 0.5 KN force on the femoral headduring assembly over stem. The design objectives of the automatic hammer are:* It must ensure application of 4.5 ± 0.5 KN of impact force.* It should provide force feedback.* It should be usable with different femoral head sizes (viz. 28 mm, 32 mm, 36 mm diameter).* It must be able to be sterilized.


### Auto-Hammer Design

The auto-hammer is designed using Solidworks package. The auto hammer consists of mainly five parts (refer figure 4):

* DC motor and planetary gear system* Rack and pinion* Spring, and,* Impulse
* Upper

The Auto-Hammer is enclosed inside a gun like housing with a pistol grip form (Refer figure 4). The femoral head is temporarily held with the help of removable lower casings that come in various sizes to meet the design criterion of accommodating different femoral head diameters. The other reason for including a removable casing is to ensure sterilizability prior to use for every patient. A spring of high stiffness (refer section 5 for spring design) is attached to the fixed upper casing. An impulse hammer is fastened permanently to the rack which is driven by the pinion. The rack passes through the center of the spring and the hole provided in the upper casing. The impulse hammer is designed to have a larger diameter that prevents it from moving up through the hole in the upper casing. The motor housing includes the planetary gear system that can deliver high torque output.

### Auto-Hammer Mechanism

A compact DC Motor with planetary gear system for high torque output is connected to a pinion of 2 cm diameter. The pinion drives the rack with the help of the torque provided by the gear. The impulse hammer along with the rack is lifted because of the rotation of the pinion. The impulse hammer compresses the spring in the process. There are only limited teeth cut on the pinion which depends on the length (10 cm) up to which the rack needs to be lifted or the linear distance up to which the vertically mounted coil spring needed to be compressed. Once the spring is compressed to the desired distance the pinion will start to disengage with the rack. As the pinion disengages with the rack, the impulse hammer along with the rack is pushed down because of the spring force. A coil spring of appropriate stiffness and length (refer section 5 for spring design) is chosen to achieve the required impact force. Hence, the impulse hammer imparts the desired impact force on the femoral head which is now assembled to the trunnion because of the blow. The feedback mechanism which is a part of the impulse hammer provides the force feedback when it impacts the femoral head. The rotation of the motor is also controlled with the help of a microcontroller for precise control.

### Spring Design

We will use a helical spring in our design to achieve the impact force of 4.5 ± 0.5 KN. We know, the amount of force derivable from spring is proportional to the amount of compression or extension along the axis of the spring and the axial stiffness of the spring. For our design, we have fixed the design envelope of the assembly Automatic-Hammer. Once the tool length is fixed, we derived the required spring stiffness. As sown in figure the length of the Automatic-Hammer has been fixed to 40 cm.

### Torque output at gear shaft

As shown above and in the Auto-Hammer mechanism, in order to achieve the output force of 4.5 ± 0.5 KN at the spring, we need to extend it using a rack and pinion mechanism which is driven by the motor and planetary gear system. To move the rack by 10 cm, we need to provide fixed amount of torque at the gear shaft and in turn at the pinion. Again, we will fix our design space and take the maximum distance (also the moment arm) between the rack and the pinion center as 2 cm.

Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) is one of the major knee ligaments that joins the upper part of the leg and lower part of the leg together and maintains the knee stability. A significant limiting factor that prevents maximal potential recovery of patients following ACL surgery is pain. The overall objective is to propose a mechanical exoskeleton that allows restricted range of motion during post- operative rehabilitation (ensures the safety of the newly reconstructed ACL graft) and a clinical testing plan to use the proposed device with the pain reducer device to understand the overall effect of the combination on the recovery of the patient.

### Solution

### Proposed Exoskeleton

The proposed exoskeleton provides an external support for the injured knee and aids the ACL patients in their rehabilitation. The integration of exoskeleton with the interferential current therapy (IFC) is relatively a novel approach in the rehabilitation process of ACL patients. As discussed, IFC reduces the knee pain aiding patients to exercise to their full potential while the exoskeleton ensures that leg movement is well within the safety limits. The main focus of the exoskeleton is to control the range of motion based on doctor’s instruction.


### Design

The exoskeleton is designed using Solidworks package. The three main components of the exoskeleton are the foot, bar and base plate. The foot is designed to accommodate the foot of the of the person. Multiple straps have been used to fasten the foot of the patient to the exoskeleton foot.  More straps could be used depending on the need. A rectangular bar connected with a pin joint at the top and having multiple holes along its length is used to connect the foot of the exoskeleton to the base plate. The purpose of the multiple holes is to adjust the length of the exoskeleton based on patient’s leg length. As specified above the bar is attached to the base plate with the help of a rotational joint. The base plate accommodates the ratchet and pawl mechanism that controls the range of motion. The base plate is tightly fastened to the thigh with the help of straps.

### Mechanism

Ratchet and pawl mechanism is used to control the rotational motion of the leg.  The mechanism is fixed to the base plate and is independent of the rotational joint. The mechanism itself is a separate entity on the base plate with the sole purpose of restricting rotational motion based on the needs. The ratchet (wheel) can rotate freely only in one direction while the motion is completely restricted in the other direction with the help of a pawl (rectangular block). When the pawl mates with a tooth of the ratchet it restricts the ratchet’s rotation in that direction. The mechanism is designed in such a way that counterclockwise rotation of the ratchet is permitted while the clockwise rotation is completely restricted. The pawl is constantly brought back to its initial position with the help of spring block and spring. The ratchet is provided with a hole through which a lock pin can be screwed. This lock pin (cylindrical rod) restricts the exoskeleton from rotating beyond a certain point with the help of the ratchet and pawl mechanism. The position of the lock pin can be varied manually by adjusting the position of the hole in the ratchet through the counterclockwise rotation. The teeth of the ratchet in this prototype are designed to provide a restriction for every five degrees from the fully stretched horizontal position of the leg.

Measurement of airflow, pressure, and sound inside the model of miniature airway tree

Airflow inside the airway tree is an important factor in the studies of pulmonary acoustics, disease studies and particle deposition inside airways. But measurement of airflow inside airways is challenging due to accessibility at different location of the tree for its geometry. Hence the results obtained in these measurements might not be accurate. The project will discuss the experimental setup for measurements of airflow and acoustics inside the airways

### Calibration

Calibration of pressure transducer using hot wire:

* Hot wire was used to calibrate the pressure transducer using the flow source of the experimental setup.
* The velocity vs voltage was found to be related in a quadratic relation.
* The velocity profile of the flow source was measured by hot wire from the top edge to the bottom edge.
* The entrance velocity profiles were found to be relatively flat with a little bit of high velocity towards the edge.

Calibration of probe microphone:
* Probe microphone was calibrated using the signal conditioner unit which generated a 1 kHz 94 dB signal.
* The generated signal was recorded using the probe microphone.
* The output of the microphone was visualized in an oscilloscope. Figure below showed the resulting output signal showed good agreement with the manufacturers standards (within 40mV-60mV).

### Velocity profile at the entrance

A Pitot tube and pressure transducer setup was used to measure velocity profile at the exit of the contraction.

* The velocity profile of the flow source (at the exit of small contraction) was measured by the pitot from one edge to the other edge in horizontal (figure 5 left) and vertical (Figure 5 right) directions.
* The figure4 shows that the Vertical and horizontal velocity profiles at the entrance of the airway model is predominantly flat#### Miniature model of a pig airway:

* A miniature model of airway tree was used to measure static pressure at the trachea.
* The miniature model of the airway tree had smaller branch diameters.
* This allowed the model to have high-pressure difference compared to large diameter models which can be measured by the pressure transducer of the setup.
* A small connection was made at the trachea for connecting pitot tube and microphone to measure the pressure and the sound generated at the location respectively.

#### Pressure measurements for the miniature airway tree

* Static pressure is then plotted against the flow rate.
* The flow rate was varied with the help of two fans.
* Different flow rates were obtained by switching both the fans on (maximum flow rate), switching both the fans off (zero flow rate), switching off one of the fans and using one of the fans with obstruction.
* The figure6 shows that the pressure loss increased as the flow rate increased.
* The pressure-flow rate relation was found to be quadratic in nature.
* Further investigation is necessary for different flow condition such as fully developed or pulsatile flow.

#### Sound measurements at the big contraction

* The hose from the fan was connected to the big contraction only.
* Microphone probe were connected to the pressure tap at the exit of the big contraction.
* Sound recorded at the pressure tap of the exit of the big contraction when both of the fan were on as well as when the flow was obstructed while the fans were running to quantify the noise generated from the fan motors and environment

### Discussion

* Pressure difference between trachea and mid bronchus increased as the flow velocity increased except at maximum flow, the difference reduced which is unexpected. Further investigation is needed
* Flow velocity at the trachea was calculated using flow meter which has a low resolution and cannot give reading at flow lower than 0.2 m/s. Pneumotachograph or spierometer is suggested to use instead of turbine flow meter
* Microphone is suggested to listen to the sounds to understand the nature of the sound at different location of the setup.
* Use another pressure transducer to check the data from diaphragm pressure transducer.
* The amplitude of the sound and the pressure loss increased for the constricted airways which is expected given the reduction of the area would lead to increase the resistance to flow.
* Uncertainty calculation showed that the uncertainty in pressure measurement is abount 0.085 Pa which would lead to a velocity measurement uncertainty of about 0.07 m/s
* The flow in this study was not laminar. Hence flow needed to be reduced to study the pressure loss at laminar flow.


### Conclusion

* Pressure drop between trachea and mid bronchus increased at higher flow rates.
* Results showed that changing flow rate would change the pressure loss as well as the sound generation in the trachea.
* Sound needs to be recorded at different branch locations for normal and constricted airways.
* Further investigation is necessary to evaluate different flow conditions like fully developed flow or pulsatile flow conditions.
