## EXPERIENCE
### Interventional Robotics Laboratory	[May’16 – Apr’17]
•	As one of the five founding members of this lab, had tremendous hands-on experience in organizing and setting up computers and lab equipment. 
•	Engineered a passive robotic arm and worked on a laparoscopic stabilization system
•	Designed an auto-hammer using SOLIDWORKS capable of providing right range of impact forces with a feedback to replace unscientific surgery procedures during total hip arthroplasty
•	Modeled a pain alleviating exoskeleton using SolidWorks for ACL rehabilitation. Utilized ‘Ratchet and Pawl’ mechanism to restrict the motion of the exoskeleton within the safety limits for faster rehabilitation
•	Made airflow and sound measurements at various generations of lung bifurcation airway model of a pig using pitot tube – pressure transducer, hot wire anemometer, turbine flowmeter, and microphones
•	Measured the flow and sound for a normal and constricted 3-D printed pig airway model with the help of data acquisition software LabView and plotted the measurements as graphs with the help of DAQ assistant
### Hyundai Motors Limited	[Dec’14 – Apr’15]
Investigated the assembly plant to find room for any improvements. Designed & developed a new pallet unlocking system for tow vehicles that dispatch materials to assembly lines. Gained valuable experience in using method study tools like flow process charts, flow & string diagrams
•	Designed an Automated Pallet Unlocking System using PRO-E and fabricated the prototype in the machining shop using cutting, welding, drilling and milling machines
•	Employed ‘Scotch Yoke Mechanism’ to achieve efficient unlocking and analyzed the crank and guide rod movements using ADAMS and ANSYS. Used Arduino electronic platform to control the proposed system
•	Implementation of the prototype improved the workflow of material dispatching process and reduced cycle time by 5.147% which was shown in the micro-motion study
### Sundaram Motors	[Dec'13]
Gained insights on 5S, lean principles and studied the mechanical parts in cars from General Motors franchise. Gained hands-on experience in engine & gear shaft assembly, and installation of disc and drum brakes

## OTHER PROJECTS
Automatic Pick and Place Robot for Palletizing (Jan’ – Apr’ 2014)
•	Designed a 3-DOF robotic arm using PRO-E and the fabrication of the arm was done in the machining lab using cutting and drilling machines 
•	Controlled the prototype using ATmega328p microcontroller with the end effector actuated by a servo motor involving ‘Bell Crank Lever Mechanism’. Used Arduino prototyping platform to control the actuators 
•	Established the force plots of gripper using ADAMS software to demonstrate efficient and stable functioning of arm 

## MEMBERSHIPS/ACTIVITIES
•	Member of Society of automotive engineers, India (2011-15)
•	Volunteered in the 7th international conference organized by English Language Teacher's Association of India (2012)
•	Coordinated and conducted a technical event for the department symposium Deus Ex Machina 11(2014)
•	‘Notetaker’- Student Accessibility Services UCF (May 2016-Present)
